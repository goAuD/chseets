### 🗺 Core Route

1. **Start — Thannhausen Castle Courtyard**  
   The heart of the village. Ivy on pale walls, wrought-iron lanterns, and the slow toll of the bell tower.  
   _Take a moment before you walk - the air is different here._
2. **Parish Church of St. Anna**  
   A small, sun-washed chapel with creaking pews and candle scent.  
   _Optional quest: find the angel carved into the left choir rail._
3. **Old Stone Bridge over the Weizbach**  
   Water beneath, murmuring like an old language.  
   Perfect spot for the Echo Capture photo quest.  
4. **Woodland Path to the Hill Bench**  
   Leaves crunch, birds shift. Each step filters thought.  
   Sit, look down: roofs, spire, castle tower - all in one frame.  
5. **Return - Castle Restaurant Terrace**  
   Local wine, cream soup, the faint ring of cutlery and talk.  
   _Badge unlock: “Still Table.”_
